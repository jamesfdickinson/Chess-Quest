Chess Quest is a new way to play chess. Each player plays the chess game while secretly works on their quests.  Quests add a new dimension to the game.  At the end of the game the winner is determined by their quest points and not just a checkmate. 

How to play

Game Play:
Play a game of chess, while secretly achieving your Quests.  All the same rules apply while playing chess.

End:
The game ends when there is a checkmate or stalemate.  Each player adds up all the points for each of their completed quests.

The player that preformed a checkmate is awarded an additional 5 points for the checkmate.  

The player with the most points wins!
